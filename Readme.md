## iQ♭

Summaries often lose the spatial structure and logical flow that help us remember and understand a text. iQ♭ preserves that structure: it ranks sentences and phrases by importance, links each main idea to the supporting passages that explain it, and highlights them by priority with concise summaries attached.

How it works:

1. Detects and ranks phrases and sentences by importance.

2. Links each top idea to the supporting passages that fully convey its intent.

3. Highlights passages by priority color and attaches short summaries for quick review.
